## Calculate this: Emotional, Micro, Employment

In modern society, we tend to value only what we can measure. As VR, neuroscans, pervasive camera technology and algorithms sort through our lives -- extrapolating our responses and well being -- emotional labour will become a booming economy.

Imagine if everyone that crosses your path walks away smiling, has increased energy and lower stress indicators. Imagine if the people you spent time with excelled in their career, pushed through personal roadblocks or just became more helpful to others. Now imagine digital payments automatically transferring into your wallet for the value you provided.

If you think that's far fetched, remember, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year on personality pills. If the deal seems backwards, you may not realize that Japan and Sweden have negative interest rates or that Switzerland is voting on giving every citizen an income just for being alive. And If you don't want to believe in rewarding others for everything they give us, perhaps you currently like money more than people.
